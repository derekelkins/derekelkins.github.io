    <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> The notion of two sets overlapping is very common. Often it is expressed
via |A \cap B \neq \varnothing|. Constructively, this is not the best definition
as it does not imply |\exists x. x \in A \land x \in B|. Even classically, this
second-class treatment of overlapping obscures important and useful connections.
In particular, writing |U \between A| for “|U| overlaps |A|”, we have a De Morgan-like
duality situation with |\between| being dual to |\subseteq|. Recognizing and
exploiting this duality, in part by using more appropriate notation for “overlaps”,
can lead to new concepts and connections.</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>The most common way I’ve seen the statement “|A| overlaps |B|” formalized
is |A \cap B \neq \varnothing|. To a constructivist, this definition isn’t
very satisfying. In particular, this definition of overlaps does not allow
us to constructively conclude that there exists an element contained in both
|A| and |B|. That is, |A \cap B \neq \varnothing| does not imply
|\exists x. x \in A \land x \in B| constructively.</p>
<p>As is usually the case, even if you are not philosophically a constructivist,
taking a constructivist perspective can often lead to better definitions and
easier to see connections. In this case, constructivism suggests the more positive
statement |\exists x. x \in A \land x \in B| be the definition of “overlaps”.
However, given that we now have two (constructively) non-equivalent definitions,
it is better to introduce notation to abstract from the particular definition. In
many cases, it makes sense to have a primitive notion of “overlaps”. Here I will
use the notation |A \between B| which is the most common option I’ve seen.</p>
<h3 id="properties">Properties</h3>
<p>We can more compactly write the quantifier-based definition as |\exists x \in A.x \in B|
using a common set-theoretic abbreviation. This presentation suggests a perhaps surprising
connection. If we swap the quantifier, we get |\forall x\in A.x \in B| which is commonly
abbreviated |A \subseteq B|. This leads to a duality between |\subseteq| and |\between|,
particularly in topological contexts. In particular, if we pick a containing set |X|,
then |\neg(U \between A) \iff U \subseteq A^c| where the complement is relative to |X|,
and |A| is assumed to be a subset of |X|. This is a De Morgan-like duality.</p>
<p>If we want to characterize these operations via an adjunction, or, more precisely, a Galois
connection, we have a slight awkwardness arising from |\subseteq| and |\between| being
binary predicates on sets. So, as a first step we’ll identify sets with predicates via, for
a set |A|, |\underline A(x) \equiv x \in A|. In terms of predicates, the adjunctions we
want are just a special case of the adjunctions characterizing the quantifiers.</p>
<p>\[\underline U(x) \land P \to \underline A(x) \iff P \to U \subseteq A\]</p>
<p>\[U \between B \to Q \iff \underline B(x) \to (\underline U(x) \to Q)\]</p>
<p>What we actually want is a formula of the form |U \between B \to Q \iff B \subseteq (\dots)|.
To do this, we need an operation that will allow us to produce a set from a predicate. This is
exactly what set comprehension does. For reasons that will become increasingly clear, we’ll
assume that |A| and |B| are subsets of a set |X|. We will then consider quantification relative
to |X|. The result we get is:</p>
<p>\[\{x \in U \mid P\} \subseteq A \iff \{x \in X \mid x \in U \land P\} \subseteq A \iff P \to U \subseteq A\]</p>
<p>\[U \between B \to Q \iff B \subseteq \{x \in X \mid x \in U \to Q\} \iff B \subseteq \{x \in U \mid \neg Q\}^c\]</p>
<p>The first and last equivalences require additionally assuming |U \subseteq X|.
The last equivalence requires classical reasoning. You can already see motivation to
limit to subsets of |X| here. First, set complementation, the |(-)^c|, only makes sense relative to
some containing set. Next, if we choose |Q \equiv \top|, then the latter formulas
state that <em>no matter what |B| is</em> it should be a subset of the expression that
follows it. Without constraining to subsets of |X|, this would require a universal
set which doesn’t exist in typical set theories.</p>
<p>Choosing |P| as |\top|, |Q| as |\bot|, and |B| as |A^c| leads to the
familiar |\neg (U \between A^c) \iff U \subseteq A|, i.e. |U| is a
subset of |A| if and only if it doesn’t overlap |A|’s complement.</p>
<p>Incidentally, characterizing |\subseteq| and |\between| in terms of Galois
connections, i.e. adjunctions, immediately gives us some properties for free via continuity.
We have |U \subseteq \bigcap_{i \in I}A_i \iff \forall i\in I.U \subseteq A_i|
and |U \between \bigcup_{i \in I}A_i \iff \exists i \in I.U \between A_i|. This
is relative to a containing set |X|, so |\bigcap_{i \in \varnothing}A_i = X|, and |U|
and each |A_i| are assumed to be subsets of |X|.</p>
<h3 id="categorical-perspective">Categorical Perspective</h3>
<p>Below I’ll perform a categorical analysis of the situation. I’ll mostly be using categorical
notation and perspectives to manipulate normal sets. That said, almost all of what I say will
be able to be generalized immediately just by reinterpreting the symbols.</p>
<p>To make things a bit cleaner in the future, and to make it easier to apply these ideas
beyond sets, I’ll introduce the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heyting_algebra">Heyting algebra</a>.
A Heyting algebra is a partially ordered set |H| satisfying the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>|H| has two elements called |\top| and |\bot| satisfying for all |x| in |H|, |\bot \leq x \leq \top|.</li>
<li>We have operations |\land| and |\lor| satisfying for all |x|, |y|, |z| in |H|,
|x \leq y \land z| if and only |x \leq y| and |x \leq z|, and similarly for |\lor|,
|x \lor y \leq z| if and only |x \leq z| and |y \leq z|.</li>
<li>We have an operation |\to| satisfying for all |x|, |y|, and |z| in |H|,
|x \land y \leq z| if and only if |x \leq y \to z|.</li>
</ol>
<p>For those familiar with category theory, you might recognize this as simply the decategorification
of the notion of a <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/bicartesian+closed+category">bicartesian closed category</a>.
We can define the <strong>pseudo-complement</strong>, |\neg x \equiv x \to \bot|.</p>
<p>Any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra_(structure)">Boolean algebra</a> is an
example of a Heyting algebra where we can define |x \to y| via |\neg x \lor y| where
here |\neg| is taken as primitive. In particular, subsets of a given set ordered by
inclusion form a Boolean algebra, and thus a Heyting algebra. The |\to| operation can also
be characterized by |x \leq y \iff (x \to y) = \top|. This lets us immediately see
that for subsets of |X|, |(A \to B) = \{x \in X \mid x \in A \to x \in B\}|. All
this can be generalized to the subobjects in any <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Heyting+category">Heyting category</a>.</p>
<p>As the notation suggests, intuitionistic logic (and thus classical logic) is another
example of a Heyting algebra.</p>
<p>We’ll write |\mathsf{Sub}(X)| for the partially ordered set of subsets of |X| ordered
by inclusion. As mentioned above, this is (classically) a Boolean algebra and thus a
Heyting algebra. Any function |f : X \to Y| gives a monotonic function
|f^* : \mathsf{Sub}(Y) \to \mathsf{Sub}(X)|. Note the swap. |f^*(U) \equiv f^{-1}(U)|.
(Alternatively, if we think of subsets in terms of characteristic functions, |f^*(U) \equiv U \circ f|.)
Earlier, we needed a way to turn predicates into sets. In this case, we’ll go the other way
and identify truth values with subsets of |1| where |1| stands for an arbitrary singleton set.
That is, |\mathsf{Sub}(1)| is the poset of truth values. |1| being the terminal object of |\mathbf{Set}|
induces the (unique) function |!_U : U \to 1| for any set |U|. This leads to the important
monotonic function |!_U^* : \mathsf{Sub}(1) \to \mathsf{Sub}(U)|. This can be described
as |!_U^*(P) = \{x \in U \mid P\}|. Note, |P| cannot contain |x| as a free variable.
In particular |!_U^*(\bot) = \varnothing| and |!_U^*(\top) = U|. This monotonic function
has left and right adjoints:</p>
<p>\[\exists_U \dashv {!_U^*} \dashv \forall_U : \mathsf{Sub}(U) \to \mathsf{Sub}(1)\]</p>
<p>|F \dashv G| for monotonic functions |F : X \to Y| and |G : Y \to X|
means |\forall x \in X. \forall y \in Y.F(x) \leq_Y y \iff x \leq_X G(y)|.</p>
<p>|\exists_U(A) \equiv \exists x \in U. x \in A| and |\forall_U(A) \equiv \forall x \in U. x \in A|.
It’s easily verified that each of these functions are monotonic.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>It seems like we should be done. These formulas are the formulas I originally gave for
|\between| and |\subseteq| in terms of quantifiers. The problem here is that these functions
are only defined for subsets of |U|. This is especially bad for interpreting |U \between A|
as |\exists_U(A)| as it excludes most of the interesting cases where |U| partially overlaps |A|.
What we need is a way to extend |\exists_U| / |\forall_U| beyond subsets of |U|. That is,
we need a suitable monotonic function |\mathsf{Sub}(X) \to \mathsf{Sub}(U)|.</p>
<p>Assume |U \subseteq X| and that we have an inclusion |\iota_U : U \hookrightarrow X|.
Then |\iota_U^* : \mathsf{Sub}(X) \to \mathsf{Sub}(U)| and |\iota_U^*(A) = U \cap A|.
This will indeed allow us to define |\subseteq| and |\between| as |U \subseteq A \equiv \forall_U(\iota_U^*(A))|
and |U \between A \equiv \exists_U(\iota_U^*(A))|. We have:</p>
<p>\[\iota_U[-] \dashv \iota_U^* \dashv U \to \iota_U[-] : \mathsf{Sub}(U) \to \mathsf{Sub}(X)\]</p>
<p>Here, |\iota_U[-]| is the direct image of |\iota_U|. This doesn’t really do anything in this case
except witness that if |A \subseteq U| then |A \subseteq X| because |U \subseteq X|.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>We can recover the earlier adjunctions by simply using these two pairs of adjunctions.
\[\begin{align}
U \between B \to Q
&amp; \iff \exists_U(\iota_U^*(B)) \to Q \\
&amp; \iff \iota_U^*(B) \subseteq {!}_U^*(Q) \\
&amp; \iff B \subseteq U \to \iota_U[{!}_U^*(Q)] \\
&amp; \iff B \subseteq \{x \in X \mid x \in U \to Q\}
\end{align}\]</p>
<p>Here the |\iota_U[-]| is crucial so that we use the |\to| of |\mathsf{Sub}(X)|
and not |\mathsf{Sub}(U)|.</p>
<p>\[\begin{align}
P \to U \subseteq A
&amp; \iff P \to \forall_U(\iota_U^*(A)) \\
&amp; \iff {!}_U^*(P) \subseteq \iota_U^*(A) \\
&amp; \iff \iota_U[{!}_U^*(P)] \subseteq A \\
&amp; \iff \{x \in X \mid x \in U \land P\} \subseteq A
\end{align}\]</p>
<p>In this case, the |\iota_U[-]| is truly doing nothing because |\{x \in X \mid x \in U \land P\}|
is the same as |\{x \in U \mid P\}|.</p>
<p>While we have |{!}_U^* \circ \exists_U \dashv {!}_U^* \circ \forall_U|, we
see that the inclusion of |\iota_U^*| is what breaks the direct connection between
|U \between A| and |U \subseteq A|.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>As a first example, write |\mathsf{Int}A| for the <strong>interior</strong> of |A| and |\bar A| for the <strong>closure</strong> of |A|
each with respect to some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space#Definition_via_open_sets">topology</a>
on a containing set |X|.
One way to define |\mathsf{Int}A| is |x \in \mathsf{Int}A| if and only if there exists an open set
containing |x| that’s a subset of |A|. Writing |\mathcal O(X)| for the set of open sets, we
can express this definition in symbols:
\[x \in \mathsf{Int}A \iff \exists U \in \mathcal O(X). x \in U \land U \subseteq A\]
We have a “dual” notion:
\[x \in \bar A \iff \forall U \in \mathcal O(X). x \in U \to U \between A\]
That is, |x| is in the closure of |A| if and only if every open set containing |x| overlaps |A|.</p>
<p>As another example, here is a fairly unusual way of characterizing a compact subset |Q|.
|Q| is <strong>compact</strong> if and only if |\{U \in \mathcal O(X) \mid Q \subseteq U\}| is open
in |\mathcal O(X)| equipped with the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Scott+topology">Scott topology</a><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.
As before, this suggests a “dual” notion characterized by |\{U \in \mathcal O(X) \mid O \between U\}|
being an open subset. A set |O| satisfying this is called <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/overt+space"><strong>overt</strong></a>.
This concept is never mentioned in traditional presentations of point-set topology because <em>every</em>
subset is overt. However, if we don’t require that <em>arbitrary</em> unions of open sets are open (and only require
finite unions to be open) as happens in <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/synthetic+topology">synthetic topology</a>
or if we aren’t working in a classical context then overtness becomes a meaningful concept.</p>
<p>One benefit of the intersection-based definition of overlaps is that it is
straightforward to generalize to many sets overlapping, namely |\bigcap_{i\in I} A_i \neq \varnothing|.
This is also readily expressible using quantifiers as: |\exists x.\forall i \in I. x \in A_i|.
As before, having an explicit “universe” set also clarifies this. So,
|\exists x \in X.\forall i \in I. x \in A_i| with |\forall i \in I. A_i \subseteq X| would
be better. The connection of |\between| to |\subseteq| suggests instead of this fully
symmetric presentation, it may still be worthwhile to single out a set producing
|\exists x \in U.\forall i \in I. x \in A_i| where |U \subseteq X|. This can be
read as “there is a point in |U| that touches/meets/overlaps every |A_i|”.
If desired we could notate this as |U \between \bigcap_{i \in I}A_i|. Negating and
complementing the |A_i| leads to the dual notion |\forall x \in U.\exists i \in I.x \in A_i|
which is equivalent to |U \subseteq \bigcup_{i \in I}A_i|. This dual notion could
be read as “the |A_i| (jointly) cover |U|” which is another common and important concept
in mathematics.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Ultimately, the concept of two (or more) sets overlapping comes up quite often. The usual
circumlocution, |A \cap B \neq \varnothing|, is both notationally and conceptually clumsy.
Treating overlapping as a first-class notion via notation and formulating definitions in terms
of it can reveal some common and important patterns.</p>
