<p>For many people interested in type systems and type theory, their first encounter with the literature presents them with this:</p>
<p><code class="asciimath">#frac(Gamma,x:tau_1 |--_Sigma e : tau_2)(Gamma |--_Sigma (lambda x:tau_1.e) : tau_1 -&gt; tau_2) -&gt;I#</code></p>
<p><code class="asciimath">#frac(Gamma |--_Sigma f : tau_1 -&gt; tau_2 \qquad Gamma |--_Sigma x : tau_1)(Gamma |--_Sigma f x : tau_2) -&gt;E#</code></p>
<p>Since this notation is ubiquitous, authors (reasonably) expect readers to already be familiar with it and thus provide no explanation. Because the notation is ubiquitous, the beginner looking for alternate resources will not escape it. All they will find is that the notation is everywhere but exists in myriad minor variations which may or may not indicate significant differences. At this point the options are: 1) to muddle on and hope understanding the notation isn’t too important, 2) look for introductory resources which typically take the form of $50+ 500+ page textbooks, or 3) give up.</p>
<p>The goal of this article is to explain the notation part-by-part in common realizations, and to cover the main idea behind the notation which is the idea of an inductively defined relation. To eliminate ambiguity and make hand-waving impossible, I’ll ground the explanations in code, in particular, in <a href="http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php">Agda</a>. That means for each example of the informal notation, there will be how it would be realized in Agda.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> It will become clear that I’m am not (just) using Agda as a formal notation to talk about these concepts, but that Agda’s<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> data type mechanism directly captures them<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>. The significance of this is that programmers are already familiar with many of the ideas behind the informal notation, and the notation is just obscuring this familiarity. Admittedly, Agda is itself pretty intimidating. I hope most of this article is accessible to those with familiarity with algebraic data types as they appear in Haskell, ML, Rust, or Swift with little to no need to look up details about Agda. Nevertheless, Agda at least has the benefit, when compared to the informal notation, of having a clear place to go to learn more, an unambiguous meaning, and tools that allow playing around with the ideas.</p>

            <p>This is a simple mathematical thought experiment from Richard Hamming to demonstrate how poor our intuition  for high dimensional spaces is. All that is needed is some basic, middle school level geometry and algebra.  Consider a 2x2 square centered at the origin. In each quadrant place circles as big as possible so that they fit in the square and don’t overlap. They’ll clearly have radius 1/2. See the image below. The question now is what’s the radius of the largest circle centered at the origin that doesn’t overlap the other circles.  <img src="../raw/high-dimensional-diagram.svg" alt />  It’s clear from symmetry that the inner circle is going to touch all the other circles at the same time, and it is clear that it is going to touch along the line from the origin to the center of one of the outer circles. So the radius of the inner circle, #r#, is just the distance from the origin to the center of one of the outer circles minus the radius of the outer circle, namely 1/2. As an equation:  <code class="asciimath">#r = sqrt(1/2^2 + 1/2^2) - 1/2 = sqrt(2)/2 - 1/2 ~~ 0.207106781#</code>  Now if we go to three dimensions we’ll have eight circles instead of four, but everything else is the same except the distances will now be <code class="asciimath">#sqrt(1/2^2 + 1/2^2 + 1/2^2)#</code>. It’s clear that the only  difference for varying dimensions is that in dimension #n# we’ll have #n# #1/2^2# terms under the square root sign. So the general solution is easily shown to be:  <code class="asciimath">#r = sqrt(n)/2 - 1/2#</code>  You should be weirded out now. If you aren’t, here’s a hint: what happens when #n = 10#? Here’s another hint: what happens as #n# approaches #oo#?</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of behavioral reflection (aka procedural reflection and no doubt other things) is to make a language where programs within the language are able to completely redefine the language as it executes. This is arguably the pinnacle of expressive power. This also means, though, local reasoning about code is utterly impossible, essentially by design.</p>
<p>Smalltalk is probably the language closest to this that is widely used. The Common Lisp MOP (Meta-Object Protocol) is also inspired by research in this vein. The ability to mutate classes and handle calls to missing methods as present in, e.g. Ruby, are also examples of very limited forms of behavioral reflection. (Though, for the latter, often the term “structural reflection” is used instead, reserving “behavioral reflection” for things beyond mere structural reflection.)</p>
<h3 id="very-brief-history">Very Brief History</h3>
<p>The seminal reference for behavioral reflection is Brian Smith’s 1982 <a href="http://publications.csail.mit.edu/lcs/specpub.php?id=840">thesis</a> on 3-LISP. This was followed by the languages <a href="http://cs.au.dk/~hosc/vol01/01-wand-friedman.html">Brown</a>, <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.40.2018&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Blond</a>, <a href="ftp://html.soic.indiana.edu/pub/techreports/TR362.pdf">Refci</a>, and <a href="http://www.is.ocha.ac.jp/~asai/Black/">Black</a> in chronological order. This is not a comprehensive list, and the last time I was in to this was about a decade ago. (Sure enough, there is some new work on Black and some very new citations of Black.)</p>

<h3 id="core-idea">Core Idea</h3>
<p>The core idea is simply to expose the state of the (potentially conceptual) interpreter and allow it to be manipulated.</p>

            <h3 id="the-category-of-graphs-as-a-presheaf">The category of graphs as a presheaf</h3>
<p>Here’s a small example of why people find category theory interesting. Consider the category, call it |ccC|, consisting of two objects, which we’ll imaginatively name |0| and |1|, and two non-identity arrows |s,t : 0 -&gt; 1|. The category of graphs (specifically directed multigraphs with loops) is the category of presheaves over |ccC|, which is to say, it’s the category of contravariant functors from |ccC| to <code class="asciimath">|cc&quot;Set&quot;|</code>. I’ll spell out what that means momentarily, but first think about what has been done. We’ve provided a complete definition of not only graphs but the entire category of graphs and graph homomorphisms given you’re familiar with very basic category theory<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. This is somewhat magical.</p>
<p>Spelling things out, |G| is a contravariant functor from |ccC| to <code class="asciimath">|cc&quot;Set&quot;|</code>. This means that |G| takes each object of |ccC| to a set, i.e. |G(0) = V| and |G(1) = E| for arbitrary sets |V| and |E|, but which will represent the vertices and edges of our graph. In addition, |G| takes the arrows in |ccC| to a (set) function, but, because it’s contravariant, it flips the arrows around. So we have, for example, |G(s) : G(1) -&gt; G(0)| or |G(s) : E -&gt; V|, and similarly for |t|. |G(s)| is a function that takes an edge and gives its source vertex, and |G(t)| gives the target. The arrows in the category of graphs are just natural transformations between the functors. In this case, that means if we have two graphs |G| and |H|, a graph homomorphism |f : G -&gt; H| is a pair of functions |f_0 : G(0) -&gt; H(0)| and |f_1 : G(1) -&gt; H(1)| that satisfy |H(s) @ f_1 = f_0 @ G(s)| and |H(t) @ f_1 = f_0 @ G(t)|. With a bit of thought you can see that all this says is that we must map the source and target of an edge |e| to the source and target of the edge |f_1(e)|. You may also have noticed that <em>any</em> pair of sets and pair of functions between them is a graph. In other words, graphs are very simple things. This takes out a lot of the magic, though it is nice that we get the right notion of graph homomorphism for free. Let me turn the magic up to 11.</p>

            <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Arguably (1-)category theory is the study of universal properties. There are three standard formulations of the notion of universal property which are all equivalent. Most introductions to category theory will cover all three and how they relate. By systematically preferring one formulation above the others, three styles of doing category theory arise with distinctive constructions and proof styles.</p>
<p>I noticed this trichotomy many years ago, but I haven’t heard anyone explicitly identify and compare these styles. Furthermore, in my opinion, one of these styles, the one I call <strong>Set</strong>-category theory, is significantly easier to use than the others, but seems poorly represented in introductions to category theory.</p>
<p>For myself, it wasn’t until I read <a href="http://www.tac.mta.ca/tac/reprints/articles/10/tr10abs.html">Basic Concepts of Enriched Category Theory</a> by G. M. Kelly and was introduced to indexed (co)limits (aka weighted (co)limits), that I began to recognize and appreciate <strong>Set</strong>-category theory. Indexed (co)limits are virtually absent from category theory introductions, and the closely related notion of (co)ends are also very weakly represented despite being far more useful than (conical) (co)limits. I don’t know why this is. Below I’ll be more focused on comparing the styles than illustrating the usefulness of indexed (co)limits. I may write an article about that in the future; in the mean time you can read “Basic Concepts of Enriched Category Theory” and just ignore the enriched aspect. Admittedly, it is definitely <em>not</em> an introduction to category theory.</p>

            <p>Normally discrete convolution is written as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code class="asciimath">#(f ** g)(n) = sum_(k=0)^n f(k)g(n-k)#</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is not immediately obvious from this that #f ** g = g ** f#. Consider this alternate representation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code class="asciimath">#(f ** g)(n) = sum_(j+k=n) f(j)g(k)#</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This formula is obviously symmetric in #f# and #g# and it clarifies an important invariant. For example, to multiply two polynomials (or formal power series) we convolve their coefficients. This looks like:</p>
<p>Let <code class="asciimath">#P(x) = sum_k a_k x^k# and #Q(x) = sum_k b_k x^k#</code> then</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code class="asciimath">#P(x)Q(x) = sum_(j+k=n) a_j b_k x^n#</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This emphasizes that the #n#th coefficient is the product of the coefficients whose degrees sum to #n#. (You may recognize this as the convolution theorem.)</p>
